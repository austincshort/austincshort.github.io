        <figcaption><em>The overall posture of the runner in the image conveys a sense of speed, agility, determination and a commitment to their performance.  The bent forward body position and the extended arms and legs suggest that the runner is in the midst of a sprint, exerting maximum effort and pushing themselves to their limit. The forward-leaning head indicates focus and concentration, as the runner is fully engaged in their moment. The logo represents StriveGov Solutions' focus on speed and agility with a commitment to a growth mindset as we strive towards delivery excellence for our clients."</em></figcaption>
